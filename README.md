## Business Understanding
The goal of this project is to provide users with a simple and effective way to track their expenses and income.  
We selected this project because managing personal finances is a common challenge, and tracking spending helps identify unnecessary costs. A challenge faced was designing visualizations that are easy for non-technical users to understand.

## Data Understanding
The project utilizes user-provided financial data, including daily expenses, income records, and savings goals.  
Future enhancements may include integration with bank APIs and automatic categorization of transactions.
